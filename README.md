## Design Principles

### UX
After looking at many different website design patterns, I have decided to go with a minimalist design for my website. I will most likely stick to minimalism until I have some sort of paradigm shift. The reason being that, in my own experience, I hate overly complicated websites that are full of junk. I want websites I build to require as little thought as possible to use for users, whilst gaining the maximum amount of value from them. From a functionality point of view this is optimal - should do no more and no less than required. 

First time experience is really key. Want that to be a great experience that leaves people wanting more.

#### Colour Scheme

Primary: orange, accent: sky, text & background: slate.

### Notes from UX/UI Udemy Course:
- Making product easy to navigate is key
- What is the exact goal of each thing I am placing on the screen
- Keep consistent patterns for navigation and interactions
- Grids are powerful, can provide great way of approaching design

### Refactoring UI/Tailwind CSS resources

Instead of reusing several of the exact same utility classes, we can use an array and map it, reducing code required for implementation.

### Experimentation

VH... Started implementing VH in this project, just realised how people build websites with seemingly perfect dimensions per page.
- This is actually not as fool proof as I thought, when I restart my project the vh trick fails...

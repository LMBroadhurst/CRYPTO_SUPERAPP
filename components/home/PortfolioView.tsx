            <p>
                Due to my interest in FX trading and engineering, I decided to
                spend some of my free time learning how to build algorithmic trading
                bots with python. Using the OANDA API, I was able to gain access to historical data to
                backtest typical retail trading strategies and run a trading bot.
                <br />
                <br />
                Seeing a bot take paper trades for me was really cool (although not profitable ðŸ˜…) and
                writing my own strategies really pushed my DSA skills.

                Tasked with building an app that would improve DEI in the workspace, I worked in a team of 3 to build
                an app that would allow colleagues to vote on ideas for social events. The app would then anonymously
                tally the results and choose the most popular option.

                I was responsible for building the React front end and designing the website. Turns out UX design is really
                hard, I took an Udemy course on UX/UI design alongside this project to give me a much needed hand.

                As I have become fluent using React, I wanted to push myself to
                cover bases and knowledge gaps I may have missed along the way.
                I have been following Kent from my first JS conference, where he
                did a short talk on Remix. I knew Kent had an
                intermediate-advanced react course so I decided to check it out,
                since he kindly has open sourced the course materials.
                <br />
                <br />
                After going through the materials this guy knows React inside
                out! Massively helped me improve my understanding of the React
                fundamentals & 'how to think in React', given me new paradigms
                of how I should be coding in React, and gave me more exposure to
                testing with Jest, RTL, and MSW.

                An E-Commerce site I built from scratch to learn more about 3rd
                party service integrations such as Firebase and Stripe. <br />
                <br />
                One thing I love about this website is that it gave me exposure
                to redux and useContext, including Authentication via firebase
                and having the `proper` Google sign in popups was pretty cool
                too. Looking back on this project, there are some major design
                issues that are hard to stomach now. e.g. Nearly all fonts are
                way too big, login/signup form especially.

                One of the first websites I built that I was proud enough to
                share. Super simple static web page inspired by a web
                development I was following on YouTube at the time, and my
                recent venture into Kickboxing. I'd argue this is actually
                better looking UI wise than some of my later projects due it's
                simplicity.
